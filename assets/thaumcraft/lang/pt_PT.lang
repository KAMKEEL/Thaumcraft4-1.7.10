# Research entries
tc.research_name.RESEARCH=Pesquisa
tc.research_text.RESEARCH=Como descobrir coisas
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.1=Antes que possas construir a maior parte dos itens e blocos thaúmicos, primeiro precisas de descobrir como fazê-lo. Existem vários passos neste processo:<BR>(1) Explorar o mundo e examinar blocos, itens e creaturas com um §5Thaumómetro§0<BR><BR>(2) Pegar nos pontos de pesquisa que recolheste do primeiro passo e expandir o teu conhecimento na §5Mesa de Pesquisa§0<BR><BR>(3) Usando aspetos que conheces e descobrindo conhecimento prático e receitas com a §5Mesa de Pesquisa§0.<LINE>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.2=§l      §n(1) Exploração§r<BR><BR>Não podes fazer pesquisas sem pontos de pesquisa, e a melhor maneira de ganhá-los é a explorar e examinar objetos no mundo.<BR>A primeira coisa de que vais precisar é construir um §5Thaumómetro§0 (ver próxima pág). Ao apontar o §5Thaumómetro§0 para objetos ou creaturas e a segurar o botão direito do rato vais começar a examiná-los. O processo não demora muito, mas a tua velocidade é reduzida enquanto o fazes.<BR>Depois de concluído, o §5Thaumómetro§0 vai mostrar que aspetos é que o objeto tem. No canto inferior direito do ecrã vais ver ver um sumário dos aspetos e pontos de pesquisa 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.3=que descobriste.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>Inicialmente não vais poder examinar todos os objetos visto que não descobriste os seus aspetos componentes. Por exemplo, um objeto que contenha o aspeto Lux apenas pode ser examinado se anteriormente descobriste o aspeto Lux, ou soubesses
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.4=os dois aspetos que combinam para creá-lo.<BR>A primeira vez que descobres um aspeto ao examinar qualquer coisa ganhas dois pontos de pesquisa a mais.<BR>Normalmente, objetos e criaturas apenas podem ser examinados uma vez.<BR>Ocasionalmente examinar algo revelará pistas adicionais sobre pesquisas thaumaturgicas, desbloqueando tópicos que podes pesquisar mais.<BR>Pesquisas descobertas desta forma vão ter ícones amarelados.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.5=§l   §n(2) Combinar Aspetos§r<BR><BR>Quando recolheres alguns pontos de pesquisa podes tentar combiná-los em aspetos compostos numa mesa de pesquisa.<BR>Para craftar uma mesa de pesquisa apenas põe duas §5mesas§0 próximas uma da outra e clica nelas com Ferramentas de Pesquisa. A receita para as mesas está listada no separador §5Artifício§0.<BR>Se abrires o inventário da mesa de pesquisa, vais ver uma interface como a da direita.<BR>As ferramentas de escrita que usaste na mesa vão estar em §l1§r. 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.6=<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:0:128:83:1</IMG>Vais ver todos os aspetos primários (e possivelmente alguns aspetos compostos) listados na área marcada §l3§r com valore variantes neles. Quando entras num mundo pela primeira vez, todos os jogadores são designados com uma pequena quantidade de aspetos primários para começares.<BR>Se fizeste alguma exploração com
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.7=o thaumómetro antes, então deves ter um número significante de aspetos primários e compostos listados aqui.<BR>Podes agora começar a combinar aspetos em aspetos compostos mais complexos simplemente clicando naqueles que queres combinar ou ao arrastá-los para os círculos na área §l4§r. Os aspetos selecionados vão aparecer na área §l4§r e quando tiveres dois deles selecionados premir o botão roxo vai tentar combiná-los. Se com sucesso deverás ver o que ganhaste no canto inferior direito e aparecerá na área §l3§r.<BR>Os aspetos usados são consumidos mesmo se a combinação não for válida.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.8=§l   §n(3) Pesquisa Primária§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:88:255:158:.5</IMG>Precisas de carregar ferramentas de escrita e papel para este passo.<BR>Se abrires o teu Thaumonomicon vais ver todo o conhecimento que tens ou podes obter.<BR>Ícones quadrados or redondos representam pesquisas primárias.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.9=Se conseguires ler o seu título (em vez de ver runas estranhas) basta simplesmente clicar nelas. Papel e tinta vão ser consumidos do teu inventário e irás ganhar notas sobre essa pesquisa. Podes agora levar estas notas para a mesa e começar a pesquisá-la ao colocá-la em §l2§r.<BR>A secção §l5§r mostra agora um papel coberto em ladrilhos hexagonais com símbolos de aspetos neles. Se vires um ponto de interrogação quer dizer que não conheces o aspeto ainda e vais precisar de aprendê-lo primero.<LINE> 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.10=Para completar a tua pesquisa simplesmente precisas de conectar e ativar todos os aspetos. Fazes isso ao arrastar um aspeto para um hex adjacente que seja ou composto por esse aspeto, ou que possa ser combinado combinado com outro aspeto para dar o aspeto que colocás-te.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:0:0:150:95:.75</IMG>Colocar um aspeto consome um ponto de pesquisa. Se te enganáres podes clicar no aspeto para removê-lo ,mas não irás recuperar o ponto de pesquisa. 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.11=Continuas a fazer isto até formares um padrão que conecte todos os aspetos iniciais. Os outros aspetos não precisam de estar conectados a todos os outros, simplesmente têm de formar um conjunto conectado.<BR>Quando isso estiver feito a pesquisa estará completa e as notas sobre a pesquisa tornar-se-ão numa descoberta.<LINE>NOTA: Colocar e remover aspetos da grelha de hex consome tinta das tuas ferramentas de pesquisa. Se ficares sem tinta não poderás proceder até o reencheres.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.12=§l    §nSecondary Research§r<BR>Hexagonal icons indicate Secondary research. Much like primary research you just need to click on them. However instead of gaining a research note, you will simply learn the research directly. Secondary research does have an aspect cost you need to pay, but they do not require you to be carrying scribing tools or paper.

tc.research_name.KNOWFRAG=Fragmentos do Conhecimento
tc.research_text.KNOWFRAG=Fragmentos do núcleo perdido
tc.research_page.KNOWFRAG.1=Nas tuas viagens podes encontrar antigos fragmentos de conhecimento perdido. Em si só, só valem alguns pontos de pesquisa quando usados, mas se recolheres suficientes deles juntos podes ganhar pesquisas únicas que podes usar. Normalmente as pesquisas que contêm não pode ser ganha por meios normais.<BR>Os fragmentos de conhecimento podem ocasionalmente gerar uma teoria falsa, mas esta só se revelará quando tentares pesquisá-la. Quando isto acontecer a maioria dos fragmentos de conhecimento retornarão para ti, o que normalmente significa que esgotaste todas as vias de pesquisa atuais em conhecimento perdido.
#
tc.research_name.ASPECTS=Aspetos da Magia
tc.research_text.ASPECTS=Os blocos de construção da magia
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.1=Todo item, objeto ou criatura está ligada a elementos variados também conhecidos como §5aspetos§0. Os aspetos descrevem a composição do objeto em relação aos elementos mágicos. Uma simples pedra pode possuir o aspeto de Terra enquanto que coisas mais complexas como árvores ou até animais podem ser feitas de aspetos variados. Há cerca de 50 aspetos conhecidos com mais a serem descobertos a toda a hora.<LINE>Existem dois tipos principais de aspetos: §5Primário§0 and §5Composto§0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.2=Os §lAspetos Primários§r são o tipo mais básico de aspetos e há apenas 6 deles: §6Aer§0 (ar), §2Terra§0 (terra), §cIgnis§0 (fogo), §3Aqua§0 (água), §7Ordo§0 (ordem), §8Perditio§0 (entropia).<BR>Estes formam o blocos básicos de construção de todos os outros aspetos.<BR>§lApetos Compostos§r são feitos de dois outros aspetos. Os aspetos compostos mais simples são feitos de dois aspetos primários, mas é possível ter aspetos compostos muito complexos que sejam feitos de camadas sucessivas de aspetos mais simples.<BR>O exemplo mais fácil de tal aspeto composto é o aspeto de Victus (vida), que é a combinção de §2Terra§0 e §3Aqua§0. 
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.3=Para ver que aspetos um item possui, apenas coloca o cursor em cima do item e prime shift, assim verás que aspetos um item tem e as suas quantidades. No entanto terás de pesquisar o item, até isso os aspetos serão desconhecidos.<LINE>Os aspects que de alguma forma foram separados do seu objeto e purificados são conhecidos como  §5Vis§0 e são valiosos: quer seja como ingrediente de craftin ou quer seja como sujeito de pesquisa mágica.<BR>Normalmente a Vis é ligada a varinhas, mas também é possível armazená-la como um líquido mágico. Vis armazenada como líquido é também conhecida por §5Essência§0.
#
tc.research_name.NODES=Auras e Nodos
tc.research_text.NODES=A magia está em todo o lado
tc.research_page.NODES.1=The §5Aura§0 is a field of magical energy prevalent throughout the world. Its origin is unclear. Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to merely be another type of energy seeping in from some other place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an §5Aura Node§0.<BR>Each aura node has a base amount of magical energy it can contain and this energy is aligned to one or more aspects. It is usually aligned to §5Primal Aspects§0, but rarely a node may contain §5Compound Aspects§0. 
tc.research_page.NODES.2=The aspects within an aura node can be tapped by a thaumaturge for his own purposes. The simplest way to do so is with the use of a wand.<BR>Energy that has been harvested in this manner is known as vis.<LINE>Aura nodes are hard to see with the naked eye, but faint glimmers of light often betray their presence. The §5Thaumometer§0 makes nodes slightly easier to find, as looking through its lens makes them clearly visible.<BR>§4Important:§0 Caution must be taken when draining a node. There is a small chance that when a specific type of aspect within a node is completely drained, it may 
tc.research_page.NODES.3=disappear or harm the integrity of the node.<BR>It is possible for the node to disappear completely if all the aspects are used up.<LINE>Fortunately most nodes replenish their aspects over time and if properly maintained can provide a clever thaumaturge with all the vis he could want.<BR>Nodes react in interesting ways to other nearby nodes and bigger nodes tend to drain the vis out of their smaller neighbours to increase their own girth.

tc.research_name.ORE=Minérios
tc.research_text.ORE=Escavar mais fundo
tc.research_page.ORE.1=§l       §nInfused Stone§r<BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research4.png:0:0:128:128:.6</IMG><BR>On occasion there is so much primal energy in an aura that it will settle into solid stone to form Infused Ore. The magic forms crystals within the rock that can be harvested.

tc.research_text.DECONSTRUCTOR=Quando dar uma olhadela não é suficiente
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.1=There comes a point in any thaumaturge's career where he is unable to progress with research due to his lack of knowledge. <BR>One possible recourse is the Deconstruction Table. The table allows you to break down objects into their simplest parts which you can examine. There are limits however - the table breaks compound aspects into their component aspects until only primal aspects remain. During this process much knowledge is lost and at best the thaumaturge can hope for is a single piece of primal knowledge.<BR>For example iron (Metallum) 
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.2=will be simplified into §2Terra§0 and §8Ordo§0, only one of which will have a chance of being discovered.<BR>It is also fairly slow and the fewer aspects and object has, the lower the chance to discover something.

It is what you use to craft objects, activate blocks like the crucible, and countless other tasks.<BR>The most basic wand stores a very limited amount of magical energy (called vis) that it uses to perform its tasks. The replenish the energy in a wand, you must right-click and hold to draw vis from an aura node.<BR>While holding a wand you will see a indicator on the top left of the screen that shows how much vis is stored within the wand.
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.2=Holding shift will display exact numbers held by the wand and any possible discounts you have to performing magical tasks.<BR>Wands are always constructed by the combination of a rod and two end-caps. As you progress with your studies, you are sure you will discover different materials that you can use to craft rods and caps to make powerful wands. Only the basic wand can be put together in a normal crafting table. All other wands require the §5Arcane Workbench§0 and will cost vis to construct.<BR>The basic wand is constructed from mundane wood and iron, both of which make poor materials for working magic.

tc.research_text.ROD_greatwood_staff=Wizards staves have knobs on the end
tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.1=Wands are the stock and trade of the thaumaturge, but sometimes you want more bang for you buck. Magical staves are basically just bigger wands. They are able to store more vis.<BR>Since they are physically larger and sturdier than a wand, they can actually be used as weapons in an emergency.<BR>Unfortunately this also makes it unsuitable for the intricate workmanship and fine control required by an arcane workbench or similar crafting.
tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.2=A staff made from greatwood has more than double the vis storage potential of a greatwood wand, being able to store up to 125 vis of each type.<BR>Note: You still need to add caps to a stave rod, just like you would for a wand.

tc.research_name.FOCUSFIRE=Foco de Varinha
tc.research_text.FOCUSFIRE=A Forma encontra a Função
tc.research_page.FOCUSFIRE.1=Some careful experimentation has shown you a way to expand the abilities of even the most basic wand.<BR>By combining crystalline vis shards with quartz crystals and infusing them with magic, you are able to align the crystals into a mystical matrix.<BR>If the proper types and amounts of vis is focused through this matrix, it will reshape the raw magical energies into something useful, controlled, and geared to a specific task. 
tc.research_page.FOCUSFIRE.2=Adding a focus to your wand is a simple task - simply press F while holding the wand, and any foci you a carrying will show up in a radial menu allowing you to chose from any of the ones you are carrying with a simple click.<LINE>Your initial experiments involved the shaping of fire, and the resulting focus proved to be a simple, but useful tool.<BR>It is capable of sending forth a cone of elemental fire, burning all in its wake.

tc.research_text.FOCUSTRADE=Isto por Aquilo
tc.research_page.FOCUSTRADE.1=You can use this focus to trade dozens of blocks in the world with some you are carrying.<BR>You must first choose the block you wish to change other blocks into by sneaking and right clicking on the desired block. When you then left-click on another block it will turn into the target block.

tc.research_text.FOCUSPRIMAL=Magia Bruta
tc.research_page.FOCUSPRIMAL.1=What madness possessed you to create this thing? This focus seems wildly dangerous and only a lunatic will attempt to use it anywhere but the most controlled environments.<BR>Granted, the orb of raw primal energy it creates is quite devastating, but its path of travel is erratic at best and downright malicious at worst.<BR>It  does beg further study however: The orb shows some interesting dimensional properties and it exhibits energy patterns you have only seen in wisps and aura nodes.

tc.research_text.ARCTABLE=Crafting with magic
tc.research_page.ARCTABLE.1=To create an Arcane Worktable simply right-click with a wand on a table you have placed in the world. The Arcane Worktable serves the same purpose as a normal crafting table, with a few key exceptions.<BR>Apart from normal crafting recipes, it can also craft some of the items unique to Thaumaturgy. To do that you need to place a wand in the top-right slot. This will allow you to craft items that require vis by drawing the energy directly from the wand.<BR>The vis required to craft an item will be shown in the six circular symbols surrounding the crafting grid.
#
tc.research_name.RESTABLE=Research Table
tc.research_text.RESTABLE=To gather knowledge
tc.research_page.RESTABLE.1=The Research table is created by placing two tables next to each other and then clicking on them with Scribing tools.<BR>The research table is the most important tool for any thaumaturge.

tc.research_name.CRUCIBLE=Alquímia Básica
tc.research_text.CRUCIBLE=Borbulhar e Ferver
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.1=To craft the Crucible, you must simply use your wand on a cauldron placed in the world.<BR>The crucible is an important tool for any thaumaturge. It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<BR>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the    
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.2=crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalyst. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<BR>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long.<BR>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it.<BR>Essentia within the crucible is constantly degrading. Compound essentia degrades into one of its component aspects, and Primal essentia simply evaporates.

tc.research_text.DISTILESSENTIA=Harvesting essentia
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.1=In the future you will defintely need to have ready access to multiple different kinds of aspects - not just primal aspects drawn from your wand.<BR>Using basic alchemical principles you have divised a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia.<BR>The first step in this process requires an §lAlchemical Furnace§r. The alchemical furnace works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.2=The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an §lArcane Alembic§r.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of an alchemical furnace. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the indivual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the alchemical furnace is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.<BR>You can stack up to 5 different alembics on top of a single furnace.<BR>The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials.

tc.research_name.JARLABEL=Warded Jars and Labels
tc.research_text.JARLABEL=Storing and organizing essentia
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.1=Essentia can be stored in §lWarded Jars§r.<BR>Warded jars can be placed in world and is able to store essentia virtually indefinitely. The enchantments placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars placed under the spout of an alembic will be automatically filled. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams and preserves.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.2=Shift clicking on jars and alembics with an empty hand will empty them.<BR>As long as a jar contains some essentia, you can attach a §lJar Label§r to it.<BR>This label will 'lock' the jar to that type of essentia and it will not be able to accept any other kind of essentia.<BR>You can remove a label by shift clicking with an empty hand on the side of the jar containing the label. Take care not to shift click on any other side as it will empty the jar as normal.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.3=You can place a label in a crafting bench with a phial of essentia to assign an aspect to it and when placed on an empty jar it will automatically lock the jar to that aspect. The essentia used in the recipe is not consumed.<BR>Placing it on a filled jar will change the label to the jar's essentia type.<LINE>A label can be made blank again by simply placing it by itself in a crafting grid.

tc.research_name.INFERNALFURNACE=Infernal Furnace
tc.research_text.INFERNALFURNACE=Hot enough?
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.1=By harnessing raw §cIgnis§0 within a furnace crafted from obsidian and netherbrick you have created a highly efficient and fuel free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a new supply of §cIgnis§0 essentia or vis every now and again. This can be done by any methods you have discovered so far, or still will discover.
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.2=It should also be noted that the occasional bit of Flux escapes into the environment.<BR>Items you wish to smelt needs to be dropped into the top of the furnace and will be spit out the front.

tc.research_name.BELLOWS=Arcane Bellows
tc.research_text.BELLOWS=Stoking the flames
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.1=The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself sending forth a stream of neverending air.<BR>Attaching it to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, resulting in a reduction of flux generated and increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.2=They can also be attached to normal or alchemical furnaces to increase their speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>Bellows can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal.<BR>You are confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually.

#
tc.research_name.INFUSION=Infusion
tc.research_text.INFUSION=Mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSION.1=Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>Infusion crafting is the process of infusing a single object with magical energy and the properties of other objects. You could, for example, infuse a stone with §6Aer§0 vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>As is usual with thaumaturgy, things are not quite that simple. To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things you need: A Runic Matrix, arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSION.2=Once you have your Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure commonly known as an Infusion Altar, you can begin to craft.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item you wish to infuse will go. You will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar where you can place the blocks and items you wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly you will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amount of vis.<BR>Once all this is gathered you can click on the Runic Matrix with a wand to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting essentia will be drained
tc.research_page.INFUSION.3=from nearby sources. Crafting will stall of there is insufficient essentia available - something that you do not want as will be explained on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>Usually one of the fusion objects get
tc.research_page.INFUSION.4=knocked off a pedestal, or flux gets generated, but more catastrophic events are not unheard of.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly you wish to keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - take careful note of where you place pedestals and make sure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing fusion items into them you may wish to keep them balanced as well. Lastly you can place occult paraphernalia around the  
tc.research_page.INFUSION.5=altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, crystals, etc.). These will have the effect of reducing instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>

tc.research_name.HOVERHARNESS=Thaumostatic Harness
tc.research_text.HOVERHARNESS=Is it a bird?
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.1=You have finally managed to unlock the secret of flight. You have created a harness that anchors itself to the Thaumic Field using thaumostatic energy allowing you to defy gravity. You think quantum's and quarks might also be involved somehow.<BR>Unusually the only vis required to power this harness is added during its creation process. Instead the fuel it requires for flight is raw Potentia. Simply right click while holding the harness to insert filled jars.<BR>Pressing 'H' while wearing the harness activates or deactivates it.
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.2=While active the harness will constantly use Potentia.<BR>It can be enchanted with the Haste enchant to increase the speed at which you move while flying.
#
tc.research_name.HOVERGIRDLE=Thaumostatic Girdle
tc.research_text.HOVERGIRDLE=Is it a plane?
tc.research_page.HOVERGIRDLE.1=This girdle is designed to be used with the Thaumostatic Harness. On its own it has very little lifting power - it has just enough to prevent most fall damage.<BR>When worn with the harness however it greatly increases the speed at which you are able to fly. The only drawback is that the harness will consume slightly more fuel than normal.
#
tc.research_name.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Advanced Golems
tc.research_text.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Maybe I should think this through...
tc.research_page.ADVANCEDGOLEM.1=You have discovered a way of improving golems in several minor, but significant ways.<BR>Firstly, golems that go through this process are able to hold one additional upgrade, though they can never have more than two upgrades of a single type.<BR>Secondly, they move slightly faster.<BR>Thirdly, they have a slightly greater sight radius.<BR>You are sure the malevolant intent in their eyes is just your imagination.  
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEBORE=Arcane Bore
tc.research_text.ARCANEBORE=Mining evolved
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.1=You have discovered a device capable of extending the range and power of an Excavation focus. Of even greater use is the fact that the machine can do so without your constant supervision. You merely need to place it on a specially constructed base, point it in the right direction with a wand and apply a redstone signal.<BR>The arcane bore requires two things to function. The first is an excavation focus placed in its leftmost inventory slot. Any enchantments applied to the focus will also alter the functions of the bore. 
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.2=Secondly you need to place any kind of pickaxe into the rightmost slot. The material of the pickaxe will have little effect on the operation of the bore, but the greater its durability, the longer it will last. Like the wand, any enchantments or special abilities of the pickaxe will also be applied to whatever the bore mines.<BR>An arcane bore can only be placed above or below an arcane bore base. Any items mined will be ejected from the base in the direction its nozzle is pointing.<BR>It will eject into an inventory if possible. This direction can be changed with a wand.
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.3=The bore can be powered with §8Perditio§0 essentia or vis which will greatly speed up the rate at which it mines. Vis or essentia can be provided by pipes and/or relays as normal.<BR>One point of §8Perditio§0 essentia will speed the bore for the next 20 blocks mined. Alternatively 5 CV is required per block mined and the bore can accept up to 100 CV per tick.

tc.research_name.LEVITATOR=Arcane Levitator
tc.research_text.LEVITATOR=Next best thing to flying
tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.1=While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 10 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>Each levitator placed upon another increases the range at which it can lift entities by 10 blocks, so a stack of 3 can lift entities up to 30 blocks.<BR>Levitators can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal to them.

tc.research_name.ARCANEEAR=Arcane Ear
tc.research_text.ARCANEEAR=Shhh, do you hear something?
tc.research_page.ARCANEEAR.1=The Arcane Ear is a device that is capable of detecting the sound emitted from nearby note blocks. If it hears a note it recognizes it will emit a short redstone pulse.<BR>The Arcane Ear needs to be tuned in a manner identical to note blocks, the tone and note it listens for depends on the material it is placed upon.
#
tc.research_name.MIRROR=Mirror Magic
tc.research_text.MIRROR=Through the looking glass
tc.research_page.MIRROR.1=You are now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved (or piped) through one mirror will pass through this realm and emerge from the other mirror - even across dimensional bounderies.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like yourself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors you simply need to place one of them in a desired location. You then right-click with a second
tc.research_page.MIRROR.2=mirror on the one you placed, and the pair will become linked. You may then place the second wherever you wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items you cannot link them to another mirror. When you pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing you to easily move it without having to relink it. However while one of the paired mirrors is picked up, you may easily relink either of them.
tc.research_page.MIRROR.3=Transporting items through mirrors places stress on the magical glass and to prevent it from shattering the mirror automatically slows down the rate at which items is spit out the other side. The greater the instability, the more the transfer rate is slowed.<BR>This instability slowly lessens over time, but it can also be negated by relaying §7Ordo§0 vis directly to the mirror.
#
tc.research_name.MIRRORHAND=Magical Hand Mirror
tc.research_text.MIRRORHAND=Personal reflection
tc.research_page.MIRRORHAND.1=This magical hand mirror functions much the same way as other magical mirrors. You simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Simple right-click while holding the linked hand mirror and you will be able to place any items in your inventory into the looking glass to have them transported.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>It should be noted that the hand mirror can only send items, not recieve them.

tc.research_name.NODEJAR=Node in a Jar
tc.research_text.NODEJAR=For the Thaumaturgist on the go
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.1=Warded jars have proven themselves capable of storing all manner of mundane and mystical things, and you believe you have discovered another use for them - trapping aura nodes.<BR>By constructing a large version of a jar around a node and enacting the proper mystical formula with your wand, the node will become trapped inside the construct which will quickly shrink to a more manageable size. The jar can then be safely picked up and moved around, but the initial trapping spell does have a very good chance of damageing the node.<BR>The node is also frozen at the state it was in when trapped, and will  
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.2=never again be able to recharge any vis it was missing.<BR>While trapped the node is kept suspended and will not regenerate vis, nor can vis be drawn from it.<BR>It is possible to free the node from the jar by placing it in the world and clicking on it with a wand. The jar will be destroyed in the process.

tc.research_name.PAVETRAVEL=Paving Stone of Travel
tc.research_text.PAVETRAVEL=Easing your journey
tc.research_page.PAVETRAVEL.1=By altering the magical structure of arcane stone you are able to create a paving stone that adds new bounce to the step of anyone walking across it.<BR>Anything walking across it will have greater speed and agility for a couple of seconds.
#
tc.research_name.PAVEWARD=Paving Stone of Warding
tc.research_text.PAVEWARD=Keeping things out
tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.1=You have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results you need an unbroken line of them between the area you wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.
tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.2=The color of the runes above the paving stone indicates its current status.<BR>Purple runes show that it is currently preventing something from passing through.<BR>Blue runes indicates it has been deactivated with a redstone signal.<BR>Red runes shows that something is preventing it from fully warding an area and a gap exists where something might be able to pass through.

tc.research_name.WANDPED=Wand Recharge Pedestal
tc.research_text.WANDPED=Automated Wand Recharging
tc.research_page.WANDPED.1=Traveling around the countryside to recharge your wand is all good and well, but an automatic way of doing it would be much better.<BR>This specially crafted pedestal does just that - any wand placed in it will automatically draw vis from nearby nodes.<BR>Nodes will not be fully drained unless it is a poor quality wand crafted from iron or sticks.
#
tc.research_name.WANDPEDFOC=Compound Recharge Focus
tc.research_text.WANDPEDFOC=For everything a use
tc.research_page.WANDPEDFOC.1=In your travels you have discovered several nodes that contain compound aspects, but as yet there has been no way to tap this rich source of vis. Until now.<BR>This focus can be placed on top of a wand recharge pedestal which will allow any wand it contains to siphon off the compound vis from nearby nodes. Unfortunately each point of compound vis is broken down into a single point of primal vis and all the excess energy is lost. However it is a good start and you are sure you will discover better ways to access this resource.

tc.research_text.ETHEREALBLOOM=Purifying Flower
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.1=Shimmerleaf is often overshadowed by its mystical neighbour the Silverwood tree, but it has magical properties of it's own.<BR>Like the Silverwood, Shimmerleaf flowers have purifying properties that lie dorment. You have found a way to awaken these properties and turn it into an Ethereal Bloom.<BR>Ethereal blooms slowly, but surely, restores land corrupted by mystical means to its former glory - this includes the blight known as Taint. While it cannot combat Taint directly, few tainted growths can survive outside their native environment for long and tend to die back.
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.2=The flower only purifies the land bathed in its light out to a range of about 8 blocks.

They have incredible strength and can carry many times their own bodyweight.<BR>Pech are normally not aggressive, but when riled up they will band together and hunt down their attacker. Under normal conditions they avoid people at all costs.<BR>Pechs are notoriously avaricious, and will loot anything not nailed
tc.research_page.PECH.2=down, though they prefer precious things. It is said that if you feed this desire for material wealth it could be possible to befriend one. Once befriended they often carry wonderous objects that they might be willing to part with.<BR>It should be noted that such 'friendships' seldom last long.<BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:136:112:120:.75</IMG>

tc.research_name.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Infusion Enchantment
tc.research_text.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Enchanting with Essentia
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.1=For ages now wizards and thaumaturges have been enchanting weapons, tools and armor by imbueing objects with their own life energy. While effective the process is tedious and the results are completely unpredictable. Your discovery of infusion crafting might have uncovered a solution to both those problems.<BR>You have discovered a way to enchant objects with an infusion altar. Simply place the item you wish to enchant on the central pedestal and supply the proper ingredients and essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.2=It also requires some life essence in the form of experience, but much less than would be normally required to enchant something. This experience is drawn from anyone near the infusion altar so care should be taken.<BR>The essentia and experience costs listed in following recipes are for the first level of enchantment. To enchant an item to higher levels, simply perform the infusion process again - it can be repeated till the required enchantment has reached its maximum possible level. Essentia and experience cost are multiplied by the level of enchantment you are performing, so a level II enchant costs twice as much as a level I.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.3=Additional costs might is also required if the item already contains enchants other than the one you are currently performing. This cost is usually around 10% per level of enchantment. So enchanting a sword with Fire Aspect I that already contains Smite III will cost 30% more.<BR>Instability also increases as the total number of enchantments on the object increases.<BR>Enchanting items with an infusion altar follows the normal rules for enchantment as it applies to what enchants can combine with others.

#
tc.research_name.TUBES=Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBES=Transportation of essentia
tc.research_page.TUBES.1=You have discovered several ways to transport essentia, but none of them has proven useful for large scale alchemical operations - until now.<BR>You have unlocked the key to creating stable and relatively leak-free tubing. While mundane chemicals can be transported in glass, certain types of essentia either disolves or simply passes right through it. By wrapping the glass in iron and treating it with quicksilver you have managed to protect it from even the most volatile types of essentia. Gold fittings finish off the piping system and makes it visually appealing.
tc.research_page.TUBES.2=The tubes can be connected to all manner of alchemical devices, though warded jars and alembics are their primary targets.<BR>Essentia flows through the tubes whenever something is connected to them that can accept it, like warded jars.<BR>Jars containing different kinds of essentia will only draw their kind of essentia towards them. Tubes however can only draw and transport one kind of essentia at a time - the highest drawing strength will take priority. Without the proper use of valves it is quite easy for a network of tubes to get gummed up. The use of valves is essential.<BR>When you see gasses being vented
tc.research_page.TUBES.3=from a tube, it means different kinds of suction are interfering with each other. The color gives a clue as to the types of suction.<LINE>The essentia valve acts much like a normal length of tubing, except it can be turned off by hand or a redstone signal. When this is done the flow off essentia through it will be cut off.<LINE>The Essentia Resonator is handy for troubleshooting your tube network. You can use it on a tube or other essentia using device to see what essentia it currently contains and the suction it is applying. 
tc.research_page.TUBES.4=Tubes can be connected and disconnected from their neighbours by clicking on a section of tubing with a wand.<BR>The wand can also be used to click on the central section to rotate certain tubes like the valve.
#
tc.research_name.CENTRIFUGE=Alchemical Centrifuge
tc.research_text.CENTRIFUGE=Taking things apart
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.1=The alchemical centrifuge is a wonderous invention that allows you to break essentia into its component parts.<BR>When compound essentia flows into the centrifuge from below it will be slowly broken down into the primal or compound essentia that it is made from. Only one of the components is created for each point of essentia broken down.<BR>The resulting essentia needs to be drawn from the top of the centrifuge. Because of the idiosyncrasies of the tube pressure system, it would be best to connect a §5Essentia Buffer§0 to the top of the centrifuge (see next page).
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.2=The essentia buffer allows you to store a limited amount of essentia - 8 points total, though it can be made up of any combination of essentia types. Like a jar it has suction, though it applies the minimum amount of suction possible (1).<BR>This means that is usually only able to draw essentia from an essentia source it is directly attached to. However tubes can be connect to all its sides, meaning that it is invaluable for getting essentia out of devices like the centrifuges that could contain variable types of essentia.<BR>You can attach bellows to the buffer - each attached bellows increases its suction by 32.

It will drop all items in its inventory of you do so. Shift-clicking will also cause it to drop any upgrades you have applied to it with the normal loss chance.<BR>It can accept a single upgrade like normal golems, but they grant unique abilities to the trunk.

tc.research_page.LAMPFERTILITY.1=Any living creatures bathed in the gentle pink glow of this lamp is immediately placed in a much more romantic mood. If they are able they will seek others of their kind to mate.<BR>This lamp will have not effect if there is 8 or more of a particular species already present.<BR>It requires victus essentia to function which can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.

tc.research_name.JARVOID=Void Jar
tc.research_text.JARVOID=Too much essentia? Impossible!
tc.research_page.JARVOID.1=Void jars function much the same as normal warded jars with one important difference - even when full they are still able to accept essentia, but the excess essentia is simply lost. This allows you to always have some essentia of that type available, but get rid of any excess that may build up.<BR>Like normal jars, void jars can accept labels, but their suction with a label is less than that of a normal labeled jar (about halfway between unlabeled and labeled jar).
#
tc.research_name.TUBEFILTER=Advanced Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBEFILTER=What you want, where you want it
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.1=§nFiltered essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except it is possible to mark them with labels. When marked they will restrict essentia flow through them to what they have been marked with.<BR>Shift-clicking on them with an empty hand will remove the label.
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.2=§nRestricted essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except they halve the any suction passing through them.<LINE>§nDirectional essentia tubes§r only accept suction from one direction. The blue markings indicate the direction from which suction will be accepted.

tc.research_name.MIRRORESSENTIA=Essentia Mirrors
tc.research_text.MIRRORESSENTIA=Essentia where you need it
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.1=Magical mirrors are very useful for transporting items over long distances, but what if that same principle can be applied to essentia? You think you have discovered a way to do just that.<BR>Essentia mirrors, like their name implies, can transport essentia in the same way that magic mirrors transport items. There are a few important limitations however.<BR>You cannot pipe essentia directly into the mirrors - they are only able to transport essentia that has been drawn from a source towards something like an Infusion Matrix.    
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.2=In effect the mirrors allow these things to draw essentia from sources via the mirror.<BR>Drawing something as unstable as essentia over such long distances has some risks and occasionaly a small amount of essentia will get lost. 
#
tc.research_name.BONEBOW=Bone Bow
tc.research_text.BONEBOW=Sticks and stones...
tc.research_page.BONEBOW.1=You have discovered a way of crafting a bow from bone and infusing it with entropic energy.<BR>The resulting weapon is capable of firing much faster than a normal bow and arrows launched from it travels faster and hit harder.
#
tc.research_name.PRIMALARROW=Primal Arrows
tc.research_text.PRIMALARROW=Arrows with an elemental bite
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.1=These arrows are each infused with a specific type of primal energy which gives them interesting and destructive properties<BR>§nAir Arrow§r<BR>These arrows crackle with energy. They inflict similar damage to normal arrows, but the magical energy bypasses any kind of armor protection.<BR>§nFire Arrow§r<BR>These arrows inflict pure fire damage and set their targets alight.
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.2=§nWater Arrow§r<BR>These arrows inflict normal damage, but chills your target to the bone, reducing their movement speed.<BR>§nEarth Arrow§r<BR>These arrows have no special property beyond packing a lot more punch than normal arrows.<BR>§nOrder Arrow§r<BR>This arrow does a little less damage than normal, but it bypasses armor and leaves your enemy weakened.<BR>§nEntropy Arrow§r<BR>This arrow does slightly less damage than normal, 
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.3=but inflicts a withering effect on whatever it hits.<LINE>Primal arrows cannot be picked up from the ground and the Infinity enchantment has only a 1 in 3 chance of preventing a primal arrow from being consumed.
#
tc.research_name.THAUMATORIUM=Automated Alchemy
tc.research_text.THAUMATORIUM=Alchemy for the masses
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.1=Up to now alchemy has been somewhat of a hit and miss affair - miscounted aspects, degrading essentia and ingredients that require manual labor to mix. This is finally a thing of the past.<BR>The Thaumatorium is a marvellous invention that allows a thaumaturge to select which formula to use and what catalysts to add. It then automatically draws essentia from available sources using tubes. As long as there is a supply of catalyst it produces the required object perfectly, everytime.<BR>The crucible that forms its base does not require water, but a heat source is still needed.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.2=When you access this device you will see several slots. The top-left slot is where you place the cataylyst. Once you have done this you will be able to choose which recipe you wish to craft with that catalyst from a list of possibilities in the top right slot.<BR>The bottom bar shows the essentia required in the order they will be required. It will also display progress bars once the machine is in operation.<BR>The created object is ejected out the front of the device or into an inventory placed in front of the ejection port.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.3=Normally a Thaumatorium can only have one active formula, but by attaching a Mnemonic Matrix to its side you can increase the number of formulas it can keep track.<BR>Each matrix increases the number of formulas by 2. 
#
tc.research_name.RUNICARMOR=Runic Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICARMOR=Shields up!
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.1=Your research into protective magics have led you to discover Runic Shielding. This is not armor in the traditional sense, but a collection of charms, rings and similar protective baubles worn with your everyday clothes.<BR>These devices create a barrier of magical energy that wards out most types of damage. The shielding has a pool of hit points from which damage is subtracted first, protecting the wearer from all harm. Once this pool is depleted the wearer starts taking damage as normal.
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.2=The pool replenishes over time and requires §2Terra§0 and §eAer§0 vis to replenish its charge which it draws from carried wands.<BR>The armor offers no protection from damage suffered due to drowning, starvation or similar environmental hazards.<BR>Due to its nature the armor cannot be enchanted by normal means, but you are sure there are ways to improve its effectiveness - you just need to discover them.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Runic Shielding Augmentation
tc.research_text.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Shields to maximum!
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.1=Rings, amulets and girdles with runic shielding is all good and well, but surely you can apply this protective enchantment to other things?<BR>Of course you can! By utilizing the magic of Thaumaturgy(c) (patent pending), you are able to add runic shielding to most magically stable pieces of armor.<BR>'Magicaly stable' items are those crafted from thaumium, enchanted fabric or similarly magical materials.<BR>Only a single charge of runic shielding is added to the item, but you can enchant an item multiple times. This is expensive and
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.2=the amount of ingredients and essentia required will increase with each level. The Salis Mundus required will equal the level of shielding you want, and the essentia cost will increase exponentially.<BR>You can enchant existing runic items like Rings of Shielding as well, however the cost is calculated based on their existing runic charge making it an exceptionally expensive process.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICCHARGED=Charged Ring of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICCHARGED=Charge for the Charge Ring!
tc.research_page.RUNICCHARGED.1=This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but increases the recharge time of runic shielding by 25%.<BR>You can wear more than one of these rings, effectively halving the normal recharge time.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICHEALING=Revitalizing Ring of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICHEALING=Go ahead, I can take it.
tc.research_page.RUNICHEALING.1=This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but when your runic shielding is breached it will release a pulse of regenerative energy that will last for a few seconds.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICKINETIC=Kinetic Girdle of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICKINETIC=Hehe, you're going to regret that.
tc.research_page.RUNICKINETIC.1=This is a specialized version of the Girdle of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the girdle it is based on, but when your shielding is breached a detonation of kinetic energy will be released damaging and shoving back anything nearby.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICEMERGENCY=Amulet of Emergency Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICEMERGENCY=You can't get me that easily.
tc.research_page.RUNICEMERGENCY.1=This is a specialized version of the Amulet of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the amulet it is based on, but when your shielding is breached this upgrade will instantly add 8 charge to your shielding amount.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once a minute.
#
tc.research_name.WARDEDARCANA=Warded Arcana
tc.research_text.WARDEDARCANA=Controlling access
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.1=Some experimentation has led to an interesting discovery - the ability to imprint memories in inanimate objects. Your first attempt at using the discovery is doors, pressure plates and other blocks that remember who placed them.<BR>The door can only be removed with a wand by the person who placed it. Additionally the door will refuse to open for anyone but its owner. The owner can also craft iron or gold keys that will grant others access to this door.<BR>By crafting an iron key and clicking on the door, you will link the key to that door. 
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.2=You can then give the key to another person and they will be able to use it on the door to gain permanent permission to open it. They will still not be able to break the door, or grant anyone else access. For that you need the gold key.<BR>The gold key serves much the same function as the iron key, except they can also grant other people iron key access to that door. Only the original owner of the door can hand out gold key access. They are also not able to remove the door with a wand. Only the original owner will be able to do that.
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.3=This pressure plate has a few novel features.<BR>Firstly it has 3 settings that can be toggled by right-clicking on it: It can trigger on everything (like a wooden pressure plate), just you, or everything except you.<BR>Secondly, like all other warded items only you can remove it.<BR>Lastly it can be linked to other players with the use of keys. These pressure plates can be used to open arcane doors as long as someone with access to the plate has access to the door as well.
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.4=Warded glass is a simple cosmetic block, but like other warded objects it cannot be broken except by the person who placed it.<BR>Keys cannot be used to give other users access.
#
tc.research_name.VISAMULET=Vis Storage
tc.research_text.VISAMULET=Waste not, Want not
tc.research_page.VISAMULET.1=Most of the time a single wand is more than enough for any thaumaturge, but there is occassions that the vis it stores just isn't enough. Carrying more than one wand would solve this, but experimentation has shown that there is another way.<BR>By crafting an amulet capable of storing vis, you will be able to recharge wands and other items in the field while it is being worn.<BR>Your success has been mixed however. You can only recharge wands while holding them in your own hand and even then the recharge rate is slow. 
tc.research_page.VISAMULET.2=However the amulet is able to act as a good power source for other things like the Repair enchant or runic shielding.<BR>The amulet can only be recharged in a wand pedestal or from nearby vis relays.
#
tc.research_name.NODESTABILIZER=Node Stabilizer
tc.research_text.NODESTABILIZER=Node Therapy
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZER.1=This handy device has several beneficial effects if placed below a node.<BR>Firstly it prevents the node from draining vis from other nodes, or being drained in turn. Secondly it prevents unstable nodes from losing their vis and it has a tiny chance of eventually removing the unstable condition completely. Lastly it has a very, very small chance of turning fading nodes into pale nodes.<BR>This requires power however and the Node Stabilizer draws this from the node itself. It does not draw enough to reduce the vis of the node, but it does halve its normal recharge rate.
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZER.2=Applying a redstone signal will switch the stabilizer off.
#
tc.research_name.NODESTABILIZERADV=Advanced Node Stabilizer
tc.research_text.NODESTABILIZERADV=Selective stabilization
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZERADV.1=Advanced Node Stabilizers perform all the functions of the lesser versions with a few major differences.<BR>Firstly they still prevent lesser nodes from having their vis drained, but it does allow stabilized nodes to drain the vis from lesser ones.<BR>Secondly it has a higher chance to improve unstable and fading nodes.<BR>Unfortunately this costs a lot more power from the stabilized node - still not enough to drain vis from it, but even the brightest node will have it's recharge rate almost completely negated.
#
tc.research_name.GOLEMFETTER=Golem Fetter
tc.research_text.GOLEMFETTER=Making them behave
tc.research_page.GOLEMFETTER.1=This simple device allows a golemancer to bring their golems to a temporary halt.<BR>If this block is activated with a redstone signal any golem that passes over it will come to complete standstill and cease its current task.<BR>Once this block is deactivated the golem will once again go about it's business.
#
tc.research_name.VISPOWER=Harnessing Vis
tc.research_text.VISPOWER=Power to the People
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.1=Without vis nodes thaumaturges would not even be able to perform the simplest of tasks, but the nodes themselves have several limitations that make their use impractical for extensive operations. Foremost amongst these limitations is the fact that they are easily depleted and it takes quite some time for them to once again gather energy from mystical source they are connected to.<BR>You think you may have found a way around that limitation. In effect nodes are tiny gateways to a mysterious font of mystical energy around which the energy slowly accumalates in the form of Vis. The gateway is so small that only a tiny
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.2=amount of energy leaks into our reality. By levering open this doorway you can cause vis to pour forth in a torrent.<BR>This is even more dangerous than it sounds however and careful steps must be taken during the entire process.<BR>Firstly the node needs to be stabilized during the entire process. Once that is done you need to craft and place a §lNode Transducer§r above the node. When you apply a redstone signal to the transducer the node will begin converting to an energized node and quickly lose its stored vis in the process.<BR>The process takes some time, but when it is done the node will
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.3=change into an energized node. Caution should be taken to keep both the stabilizer and transducer active from now on.<LINE>Energized nodes no longer store or recharge vis, nor can vis be drawn from them with a wand or other means. Instead they produce a steady supply of §lCV§r (centi-vis, or a hundreth of a vis) each tick. This energy can be tapped by placing vis relays near the energized node.<BR>Each relay acts as a conduit for CV and any number of relays can be placed within 8 blocks of an energized node. Relays also transfer energy to each other allowing you to create a network that transports vis to
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.4=anything that needs it, like the Infernal Furnace.<BR>Relays use a branching system, so each relay can have only one source (either another relay, or an energized node), but may have multiple child relays that branch off it.<BR>You can also 'tune' a relay to one of the primal aspects by using an appropriate vis shard on it. This does not limit what vis can flow through that relay, but does prevent it from connecting to any other relay except untuned ones or ones tuned to the same primal.<BR>The amount of energy a node produces per tick is finite so attaching too many devices to a 
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.5=single source might exceed the amount of CV it can produce.<LINE>It is possible to turn an energized node back into a normal node. Simply cut the redstone signal to the transducer and it slowly turn it back into a normal node. Caution should be taken however since the node will be completely drained of vis and thus runs the risk of being damaged.
#
tc.research_name.VISCHARGERELAY=Vis Charging Relay
tc.research_text.VISCHARGERELAY=Arcane Crafting Simplified
tc.research_page.VISCHARGERELAY.1=An annoyance for any thaumaturge that performs regular arcane crafting is to constantly keep his wand charged.<BR>Now that you have found a way to draw vis directly from nodes you are able to craft a Vis Charging Relay. This functions like a normal relay, but is designed to placed on top of an arcane crafting table. It will draw vis from the relay and recharge wands placed in the table.<BR>The only drawback is that it recharges much slower than it would from a wand recharging pedestal or doing it by hand. 
#
tc.research_name.WARP=Warp, Flux and all things bad
tc.research_text.WARP=Everything has a price
tc.research_page.WARP.1=§nWarp§r<BR>Many believe man was not meant to meddle with magic, and nothing gives more credence to this than the existence of Warp.<BR>Researching forbidden magics or crafting objects of a questionable nature tends to distort a thaumaturges view of reality, twisting both their minds and their bodies. This effect is called Warp.<BR>While some warp gained is temporary and will fade over time, there is no known way to get rid of permanent Warp once it is gained and a thaumaturge who chooses to ignore the dangers in the pursuit of power
tc.research_page.WARP.2=often finds himself on a slippery slope.<BR>Warp usually manifests as minor lapses in concentration, physical pain or hallucinations.<BR>These are more than merely mental though, as the visions sometimes impart useful knowledge or seeming hallucinations prove to be frighteningly real.
tc.research_page.WARP.3=§nFlux§r<BR>If Warp is the mental manifestation of magic gone wrong, then Flux is its physical manifestation.<BR>Flux can manifest in three ways: a liquid, a gas and a physical malady. The first two manifestations are considered annoyances by most thaumaturges and is often the result of wasteful use of magic. It is not particularly hard to clean up, but coming into contact with it often causes the third manifestation: Flux Flu<BR>Flux Flu is not particularly dangerous, but while a thaumaturge is suffering from it he finds it difficult to focus vis which often leads to increased vis usage to get something done.
#
tc.research_name.BATHSALTS=Purifying Bath Salts
tc.research_text.BATHSALTS=Stress relief for the mind
tc.research_page.BATHSALTS.1=Warp is a danger for even the most careful of thaumaturges. For those that have done a bit too much dabbling Warp effects are probably more than just an annoyance. Purifying Bath Salts help with that.<BR>Simply tossing these salts into water will turn the water into a silvery, purifying liquid that sooths away the stresses of the day and brings temporary relief from the effects of Warp. It should be noted however the the more warp a thaumaturge suffers from, the shorter the duration of this protection.<BR>The salts are quite fragile and will soon dissolve if tossed around haphazardly. 
#
tc.research_name.LIQUIDDEATH=Liquid Death
tc.research_text.LIQUIDDEATH=For external use only
tc.research_page.LIQUIDDEATH.1=This liquid is so dangerously toxic that virtually nothing can prevent it from dissolving flesh, bone and even harder substances. Nothing alive or that even displays the semblance of life can survive it.<BR>Apart from obvious practical applications, this vile substance has another interesting property: Any essentia a dissolved creature possessed form into crystals that can be harvested.<BR>I will leave it to the reader's imagination what uses those crystals can be put to. 
#
tc.research_name.ARMORFORTRESS=Thaumium Fortress Armor
tc.research_text.ARMORFORTRESS=Nothing is getting in
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.1=Thaumium armor has many things to recommend it, but its basic construction leaves it inferior to diamond armor. By improving the construction process and complexity you have found a way to create armor of exceptional craftsmanship, durability and strength.<BR>Each individual piece of Thaumium Fortress armor has the same protective properties as diamond armor, but has greater durability and offers additional protection against magic and fire.<BR>The biggest benefit however is that the individual armor pieces is designed and constructed to be worn together: Each additional
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.2=piece of this armor worn increases the overall protection offered by all other pieces and improves its visual appeal.<BR>As with most objects constructed from thaumium, the armor is easy to enchant.

tc.research_page.HELMGOGGLES.1=Usually a thaumaturge needs to choose between protection or utility when out and about. Not anymore!<BR>This modifies a Thaumium Fortress Helm to give you all the functionality of Goggles of Revealing.

tc.research_text.MASKGRINNINGDEVIL=Thaumium Fortress Helm Upgrade
tc.research_page.MASKGRINNINGDEVIL.1=This mask is designed to be added to an existing Thaumium Fortress helm.<BR>When worn, this mask has an interesting damping effect on those suffering from Warp event. While it does not reduce the number of events, it does reduce their severity somewhat.<BR>It seems laughing in the face of danger does have its rewards.

tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.1=By infusing magic into metal you had managed to create Thaumium. It was a worthy discovery, but the time has come to leave thaumium to amateurs and dabblers.<BR>A strange and half-remembered dream has given you the urge to try something... different. What if you infuse metal with more than just magic, but with the very essense where magic is drawn from: Darkness and the Void that dwells between the stars.<BR>The resulting metal is disturbingly slick and warm to the touch. It is almost as soft as gold making it easy to work, but
tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.2=when struck it becomes as hard as thaumium and sometimes even harder. More impressively all but the most devestating damage soon repairs itself as the metal slowly flows back into place.<BR>The only downside is that it isn't as easy to enchant as thaumium, but still compares favourably to mundane materials like iron.<BR>You have discovered that care must be taken when handling the metal - being harmed by it seems to temporarily sap your strength.
