* Do not post questions, ideas or suggestions unless they directly correlate to a bug you're reporting. If you want to do any of the former, do so on the [TC thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-).
* Check the other issues first to make sure yours hasn't been reported yet.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of Thaumcraft and Forge;
* Do not report issues for 1.6 versions of Thaumcraft, they aren't supported any more.
* Make sure you list your TC and Forge version at the top of any issue.
* Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron are not accepted. If you find an issue in a server running MCPC+/Cauldron, try to reproduce it in a vanilla (Forge) server. If you can't, report the issue to the MCPC+/Cauldron issue tracker, not here;
* Issues regarding running Thaumcraft in a developer environment are not accepted, this is not TC addon development hotline;
* Render related issues with Optifine (that work fine without it) are not accepted;
* Post the FML log (if there's a crash) on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or any other pastebin;
* Refer what mods you are running, if the game didn't crash;
* Make sure NEI block highlights are off if thaumcraft things are disappearing/changing into something else while looking at them;
* You don't need to prefix or suffix your issue titles with [Bug] or [Idea] or anything in square brackets, put the info inside the issue text, if anything needs to be flagged, we take care of it.
* Make sure your title is a good resume of the issue, "Research bug" or "Entity crash" are not good titles, for one.
* Open up **one** issue for each bug, don't put various bugs in a single issue, it makes it harder to sort through.
* If you want to add information or discuss an issue that has been closed, do not open a new one. You can comment on the closed one.
* Don't edit en_US.lang
* Read the FaQ in the [TC thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-).
